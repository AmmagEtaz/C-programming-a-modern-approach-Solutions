## Question:
<pre>
Suppose that high, low, and middle are all pointer variables of the same type, and that
low and high point to elements of an array. Why is the following statement illegal, and
how could it be fixed?

middle = (low + high) / 2;
</pre>

## Answer
<pre>
The statement is illegal because pointers cannot be added. Here's a legal statement that has the desired effect:
middle = low + (high - low) / 2;

The value of (high - low) / 2 is an integer, not a pointer, so it can legally be added to low.
