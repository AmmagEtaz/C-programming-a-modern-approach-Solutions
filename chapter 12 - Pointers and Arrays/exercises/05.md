## Question:
<pre>
  Suppose that a is a one-dimensional array and p is a pointer variable. Assuming that the
  assignment p = a has just been performed, which of the following expessions are illegal
  because of mismatched types? Of the remaining expressions, which are true (have a nonzero
  value)?

  (a) p == a[0]
  (b) p == &a[0]
  (c) *p == a[0]
  (d) p[0] == a[0]
</pre>

## Answer:
<pre>
  (a) illegal - &a[0] compared to a[0]
  (b) legal and true - &a[0] compared to &a[0]
  (c) legal and true - *&a[0] (which is equivalent to a[0]) compared to a[0]
  (d) legal and true - *(p + 0) compared to a[0]
</pre>
