## Question:
<pre>
  Suppose that p has been declared as follows:

  char *p = "abc";

  Which of the following function calls are legal? Show the output produced by each legal
  call, and explain why the others are illegal.
</pre>

## Answer:
<pre>
  (a) illegal. Putchar expects a character, not a pointer to a character.
  (b) legal. It passes to the putchar function the value that the pointer *p points at (p[0]), which is a character, as expected from putchar.
  (c) Legal. Puts expects a pointer to a string.
  (d) legal. Puts expects a pointer, not the char value that the pointer p points at.
