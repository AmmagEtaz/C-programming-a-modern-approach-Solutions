## Question:
<pre>
  The following function calls supposedly write a single new-line character,
  but some are incorrect. Identify which calls don't work and explain why.

  (a) printf("%c\n", '\n');      (g) putchar('\n');
  (b) printf("%c\n", "\n");      (h) putchar("\n");
  (c) printf("%s\n", '\n');      (i) puts('\n');
  (d) printf("%s\n", "\n");      (j) puts("\n");
  (e) printf('\n');              (k) puts("");
  (f) printf("\n");
</pre>

## Answer:
<pre>
  (b) Expects character to be of type char, but the type is char *
  (c) '\n' isn't a string (it's type char) so it doesn't work with the conversion specification "%s" (which expects type char *)
  (e) printf expects a pointer (char *), '\n' is a character (char)
  (h) putchar, as the name implies, expects a character (type char), but "\n" is a string (type char *)
  (i) puts expects a string (char *), '\n' is a character (char)
  (j) puts automatically prints a new-line character at the end of a string, so "\n" is redundant
