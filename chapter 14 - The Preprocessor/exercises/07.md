## Question:
<pre>
Let GENERIC_MAX be the following macro:

#define GENERIC_MAX(type)        \
type type##_max(type x, type y)  \
{                                \
return x > y ? x : y;            \
}

(a) Show the preprocessor's expansion of GENERIC_MAX(long).
(b) Explain why GENERIC_MAX doesn't work for basic types such as unsigned long.
(c) Describe a technique that would allow us to use GENERIC_MAX with basic
types such as unsigned long. Hint don't change the definition of GENERIC_MAX.
/</pre>

## Answer:
<b>(a)</b>
<pre>
long long_max(long x, long y)
{
   return x > y ? x : y;
}
</pre>

<b>(b)</b>
<pre>
I doesn't work because 'type' is turned into the argument/parameter given to GENERIC_MAX and then added to _max.
If there are two words, there will be a space between them, so it will be something like 'type0 type_max'.
</pre>

<b>(c)</b>
<pre>
We can create a custom type using typedef, starting from basic types such as unsigned long.
For example:
typedef unsigned long un_long;
So when we pass u_long to the GENERIC_MAX macro, the function name joins
    the tokens un_long and _max to create un_long_max.
