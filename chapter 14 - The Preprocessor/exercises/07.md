## Answer:
<b>(a)</b>
<pre>
long long_max(long x, long y)
{
   return x > y ? x : y;
}
</pre>

<b>(b)</b>
<pre>
I doesn't work because 'type' is turned into the argument/parameter given to GENERIC_MAX and then added to _max.
If there are two words, there will be a space between them, so it will be something like 'type0 type_max'.

<b>(c)</b>

We can create a custom type using typedef, starting from basic types such as unsigned long.
For example:
typedef unsigned long un_long;
So when we pass u_long to the GENERIC_MAX macro, the function name joins
    the tokens un_long and _max to create un_long_max.
