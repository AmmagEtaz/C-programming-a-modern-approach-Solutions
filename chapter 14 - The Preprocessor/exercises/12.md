## Question:
<pre>
Suppose that the macro M has been defined as follows:

#define M 10

Which of the following tests will fail?

(a) #if M
(b) #ifdef M
(c) #ifndef M
(d) #if defined(M)
(e) #if !defined(M)
</pre>

## Answer:
<pre>
(c) fail
(e) fail
The reason is that the tests ask whether M is undefined. M is defined so the condition tests false.
