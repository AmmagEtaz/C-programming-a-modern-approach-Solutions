## Question:
<pre>
Functions can often--but not always--be written as parameterized macros. Discuss
what characteristics of a function would make it suitable as a macro.
</pre>

## Answer:
<pre>
- Macros' arguments aren't type-checked.
- It's not possible to have a pointer to a macro. Macros are removed during preprocessing, 
  so it's impossible to "point" to them.
- A macro may evaluate its arguments more than once. Evaluating an argument more than once 
  can cause unexpected behaviour if the argument has side effects.
